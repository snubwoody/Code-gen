## Draughtsman
VS Code extension that generates components and routes in js frameworks. Only Next is supported now but support for other frameworks will be coming soon.

⚠️This is extension in alpha⚠️ 

**Important!!!**
Make sure you read through this before using the extension

### Usage
To use this extension you must:
- Be using typescript in your project
- Activate the extension in the root directory of your project
- Have tailwind installed and configured in your project

Only Next JS is supported currently, support for more frameworks will be coming soon.

### Examples
You can generate components using the 'Generate component' command. This will place the generated component in the src/components directory and will create it if it doesn't exist.

****
You can generate routes using the 'Generate route' command. This will create a new app/[route-name] directory with a page.tsx file.
